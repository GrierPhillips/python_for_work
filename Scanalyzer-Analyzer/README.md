## Scanalyzer Analyzer ##

The Scanalyzer Analyzer is an application intended for use with a Lemnatec Scanalyzer. Its purpose is to allow a user to read in csv files produced from experiments on the Scanalyzer and run analysis on them, producing an Exel file with tables and graphs in a standardized format.

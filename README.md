# Python for Work
This repository contains various scripts used for a few simple processes in my work at Novozymes.

Unfortunately not everything that I develop for work can be posted online. Only non-sensitive information will be included.

## Scanalyzer Note

If you are looking for the Scanalyzer Analyzer it has been moved to its own repository available [here](https://github.com/GrierPhillips/Scanalyzer_Analyzer).
